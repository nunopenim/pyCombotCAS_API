> TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

 1. Do whatever you like with the original work, just don't be a dick.

     Being a dick includes - but is not limited to - the following instances:

	 1a. Outright copyright infringement - Don't just copy the original work/works and change the name.  
	 1b. Selling the unmodified original with no work done what-so-ever, that's REALLY being a dick.  
	 1c. Modifying the original work to contain hidden harmful content. That would make you a PROPER dick.  
	 1d. Selling a project with educational purposes without consulting the original creator. That would make you a BAG of dicks.  
	 
 2. If you become rich through modifications, related works/services, or supporting the original work,
 share the love. Only a dick would make loads off this work and not buy the original work's 
 creator(s) a beer or a pizza.
 
 3. Code is provided with no warranty. Using somebody else's code and bitching when it goes wrong makes 
 you a DONKEY dick. Fix the problem yourself or submit a [bug report](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html), so that the 
 original creator can attempt to fix the problem. Just don't bitch about it.
